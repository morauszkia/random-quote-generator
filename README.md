6. On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with `id="text"`.
7. On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with `id="author"`.
8. When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.
